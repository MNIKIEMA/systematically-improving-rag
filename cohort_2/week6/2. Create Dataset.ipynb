    "> If you haven't already, please run the [1. Evaluate Tools](1. Evaluate Tools.ipynb) notebook to understand how to evaluate your application's tool calling capabilities. That will help you understand what we're doing here in this notebook.\n",

    "## Generating Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to evaluate the recall of our application's tool calling capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we'll generate a synthetic dataset of queries using a small subset of Raycast's extensions. Similar to our previous notebook, we'll use a `.yaml` file to store the extensions we support so that it's easy to add or remove extensions from our function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do so in 3 steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extracting Commands** : We'll first start by extracting out a list of commands from a short list of raycast extensions before writing them to a yaml file.\n",
    "2. **Generating Queries** : We'll then generate some synthetic queries for each of these commands\n",
    "3. **Benchmark** : Lastly, we'll benchmark our application's tool calling capabilities against this dataset and measure the precision and recall of our application for these queries to get an initial baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating Our Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, Raycast exposes the commands for each extension in a package.json file that we can download. These have the following structure\n",

    "    ],\n",
    "    // ... other metadata goes here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take these commands and parse them into a structured yaml file that will be in the following format\n",
