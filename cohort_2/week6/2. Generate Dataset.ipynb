    "We'll do so in 3 steps\n",

    "1. **Failure Modes** : We'll first start by thinking about the specific failure modes that our model might struggle and show examples where our model might get confused\n",

    "2. **Generating Synthetic Prompts** : We'll then generate synthetic prompts for each command that take advantage and specifically test these failure modes.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to deciding what tools to call for a personal assistant, there are two main failure points that our model might struggle with.    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A Lack Of Context** : It's common for users to use multiple note taking apps. We have Notion for company documents, Obsidian for personal notes and Apple Notes for quick notes that are more ephemeral. But it's difficult for a language model to know exactly which app to use when the user makes a request like `Sarah just got back to me on the project that our campaign was approved. can you make a note in our project page about it?` vs `I'm going shopping for groceries later, can you remind me that i need to buy milk, eggs and bread?`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Step Tasks** : When we start scaling out our application to support calling multiple applications, we might find that our model struggles with multi-step tasks. For instance, given the request `create a new feature branch for the UI refactor and link all the tickets you've found about onboarding issues in the PR description`, we might find that our model struggles to call the required tools in the correct order or even call the tools at all.\n",
