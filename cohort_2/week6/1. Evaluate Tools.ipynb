    "## Evaluating Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to evaluate how well our model performs when it comes to calling tools. In order to do so, we'll be using two main metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Precision : How many of our tools called are relevant to the query\n",
    "2. Recall : How many of our relevant tools are called\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want both of these metrics to be as high as possible but we want to prioritize precision over recall. This is because we want to avoid wasting resources on calling irrelevant tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "This increases the latency and cost of our application, degrading the user experience. We'll be looking at a simple case study once we build some intuition for how we might evaluate our model's performance before moving on to practical tips on how to scale up the number of tools our application can call and improve reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raycast Natural Language Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Raycast is an application which enables you to launch custom shortcuts and integrations on your computer. It combines a variety of different integrations with tools such as Jira, Airtable, Google among many others and will be launching an easy way to help prompt extensions with natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given the command `@calendar when's my next meeting?`, Raycast will be able to execute a series of commands that you have installed which will fetch all of your meetings and then return your next meeting timing after the current time. This will allow users to be able to interact with their system quickly and effeciently. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook series, we'll look at how we might prototype a similar application. We'll do so over 3 notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluation**: Using a simple set of tools, we'll calculate precision and recall and see how to use these two metrics to evaluate the tools a model has called relative to a set of expected tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Synthetic Data** : Once we've built some intuition for how this evaluation works, we'll then generate a synthetic dataset of queries that we can use to evaluate the performance of a model to translate natural language queries into raycast commands. We'll then measure the impact of different techniques like few-shot examples and synthetic data generation to cover weak spots in our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Retrieval**: Finally, we'll look at how we might scale up the number of tools we have in our application by dynamically retrieving relevant tools for a given query. We'll then compare this against our original few-shot and static baselines and see how we can improve model performance."

    "2. **Tool Calling** : We'll then see how we can evalute the performance of our model using these metrics by writing simple assertions and unit tests\n",
    "3. **Parallel Tool Calling**: We'll then see how we can leverage parallel tool calling to improve the latency of our application and improve the performance of our model\n",

    "1. **Latency** : There's actually an increase in the latency with parallel tool calling which is surprising because we expect parallel tool calling to be faster. \n",
    "2. **Precision and Recall** : There's a 40% drop in precision and a 60% drop in recall with parallel tool calling. This means that our model is not only calling tools that are less relevant to the user's query but also calling less tools in general.\n",

    "2. It struggles to call tools in combination with one another\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we've built some intuition for how we might evaluate our model's tool calling capabilities, we'll start looking at how these metrics can be applied as we scale up the number of tools that we have in our application.\n",

    "Specificaly, we'll start thinking about questions such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- What sort of trade offs do we see when we scale up the number of tools that we have in our application?\n",
    "- How do we decide which tools to include in our application?\n",
