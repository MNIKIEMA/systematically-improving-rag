    "# Why Use Topic Modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large-scale RAG applications, understanding performance across different query types becomes challenging. Topic modeling helps solve this by automatically clustering similar queries, allowing us to efficiently identify patterns and potential issues in our system's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Bertopic because it provides a few benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a modular architecture that allows us to swap out embedding models, clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques easily \n",
    "- It has built in visualisation and analysis tools\n",
    "- It offers a large amount of extensions that we can use to guide the model to generate topics that we care about\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying these techniques in production, make sure to use dynamic topic modelling so that the topics are preserved over time. Additionally it's useful to help get domain experts to guide the topic creation so that the topics are more fine-grained and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is a technique that allows us to identify clusters of related queries at scale using unsupervised techniques. We can then manually inspect samples from each cluster to understand what sort of queries we're getting and how well we're doing on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's important here to note that topic modelling is just a way for us to come up with explicit classifications for queries. "

    "UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that we can use to reduce the dimensionality of our data. We'll use it here to reduce the dimensionality of our embeddings before clustering. By fixing the random state, we can ensure that the final results are consistent."
